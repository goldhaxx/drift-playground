# .cursorindexingignore files automatically inherits all patterns from your 
# .gitignore files

# The .cursorindexingignore file only controls which files are indexed for search 
# and context features. This provides the same indexing control as the old 
# .cursorignore. Use this file when you want to:

# Exclude large generated files from indexing
# Skip indexing of binary files
# Control which parts of your codebase are searchable
# Optimize indexing performance
# Important: Files in .cursorindexingignore can still be manually included as context or accessed by AI features - they just wonâ€™t be automatically indexed or included in search results.
