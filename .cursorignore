# The .cursorignore file makes a best-effort attempt to
# exclude files from both AI features and indexing. 
# This is useful for:

# Attempting to exclude sensitive files from AI access and indexing
# Excluding configuration files with secrets
# Limiting access to proprietary code

# Files listed in .cursorignore will be excluded from Cursorâ€™s AI features in a best-effort way:

# Not included in tab and chat requests
# Not included in context for AI features
# Not indexed for search or context features
# Not available through @-symbols or other context tools
